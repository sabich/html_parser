Interior sitting area has faux lamb's wool material (polyester) for comfort. <br>\n<b>Color: <\/b>Assorted colors; please choose from included color options<br>\n<b>Care Instructions: <\/b> Cover is removable and machine washable and dryable. Wash in warm water and tumble dry on low heat.<br>\n<b>Directions: <\/b><br> Place the Lookout on either the front or rear seat of your vehicle. It will be high enough so that when your pet is inside they will be able to look out the window and see what's happening outside. This keeps them interested in their ride and they won't want to climb on your shoulders or in your lap, making for a safer ride. Our customers also tell us that motion sickness has been reduced for many pets. Bring the car's shoulder strap and lap belt down through the open channel along the back of the Lookout seat and snap it into the seat belt receptacle. This fastens the Lookout to the car. For safety during sudden stops your pet should have a harness and be strapped into the Lookout. A containment strap is supplied with the Lookout. The hook end attaches to your harness's \"D\" ring and the other end clips around the lap belt. DO NOT ATTACH THE STRAP TO THE PET'S COLLAR. Adjust the harness so that your pet has movement but cannot get out of the Lookout. In the beginning your pet may move side to side. You can always put a safety pin through the supplied strap and the seat belt to keep the strap centered in the seat. It can be removed as your pet becomes accustomed to the Lookout (safety pin is not supplied).<\/p>\n<p>Your pet will quickly realize they can see out or sleep comfortably keeping both you and your pet safe during sudden stops. Use the Lookout at home or in hotels as your pet&amp;339;s bed and then move it into the car for travel. Your pet will look forward to sleeping in it at night. Available in a variety of colors you are sure to find the perfect car seat to match your car, or your individual style.<br>\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Sizing Guide: <\/b> For help determining which size seat is best for your pet, we recommend cutting out a piece of newspaper to the interior dimensions of each seat and placing your pet on each. This will help determine what size would be most comfortable for your pet.<br>\n<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/div>\n"

The Snoozer Console Lookout is designed for pets up to 7 lb (small) or up to 12 lb (large SUV).Two sizes to choose from.\n<p><b>Features: <\/b><\/p>\n<li>Comfortable Sherpa interior<\/li>\n<li>Helps alleviate car sickness<\/li>\n<li>Containment strap included<\/li>\n<li>Keeps pets restrained making for a safe ride for all passengers<br>\n<p><b>Includes: <\/b>1 Seat<br>\n<b>Intended Pet(s): <\/b> Dogs<br>\n<b>Material(s): <\/b> Polyurethane foam form with cover made of quilted nylon, poly\/cotton, or vinyl.

Thread it between the upper seat cushion and lower seat cushion on both the driver and passenger seats adjacent to the console. There should be a metal support that the containment strap can go around and then be re-connected making a circle.

Once in position you may chose to leave it there permanently.<\/p>\n<p>Place the seat on the console with the safety strap to the back end and the front strap facing forward. Lift the console lid and wrap the single front strap under the lid and tighten. When the console snaps shut this strap simply prevents the console from tilting and is not intended as security in braking or accidents.<\/p>\n<p>Next, open the containment straps previously installed and reattach them to the safety strap loops on the underside of the seat. Adjust the straps to tighten the seat to the console. Once the seat is in place, the clasp on the safety strap is attached to your pet by his HARNESS. DO NOT ATTACH TO A COLLAR. Tighten the safety strap to keep your pet in the seat until they realize its comfort.<\/p>\n<p>To remove the seat, simply open the buckle on the containment strap and remove the seat. Close the buckles and leave the containment straps in place for use later.<br>\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Available Sizes<\/b><br>\nSmall: For Pets up to 7 lb, Interior sitting area measures 14 in L x 6 in W x 4 in H.

Once the seat is in\nplace, the clasp on the safety strap is attached to your pet by his HARNESS. DO\nNOT ATTACH TO A COLLAR. Tighten the safety strap to keep your pet in the seat\nuntil they realize its comfort. To remove the seat, simply open the buckle on\nthe containment strap and remove the seat. Close the buckles and leave the\ncontainment straps in place for use later. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n"

It will be high enough so that when your pet is inside they will\nbe able to look out the window and see what's happening outside. This keeps them\ninterested in their ride and they won't want to climb on your shoulders or in\nyour lap, making for a safer ride. Our customers also tell us that motion\nsickness has been reduced for many pets. Bring the car's shoulder strap and lap\nbelt down through the open channel along the back of the Lookout seat and snap\nit into the seat belt receptacle. This fastens the Lookout to the car. For\nsafety during sudden stops your pet should have a harness and be strapped into\nthe Lookout. A containment strap is supplied with the Lookout. The hook end\nattaches to your harness's \"D\" ring and the other end clips around the lap belt.\nDO NOT ATTACH THE STRAP TO THE PET'S COLLAR. Adjust the harness so that your pet\nhas movement but cannot get out of the Lookout. In the beginning your pet may\nmove side to side. You can always put a safety pin through the supplied strap\nand the seat belt to keep the strap centered in the seat. It can be removed as\nyour pet becomes accustomed to the Lookout (safety pin is not supplied). Your\npet will quickly realize they can see out or sleep comfortably keeping both you\nand your pet safe during sudden stops. Use the Lookout at home or in hotels as\nyour pet's bed and then move it into the car for travel. Your pet will look\nforward to sleeping in it at night. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n"

The Ovation single-door crate features\nthe innovative, patent-pending Up &amp; Away Door along with all of the features\nthat are sought after in wire crates for dogs. To open the door, simply grab the\ncomfort-grip handle and lift and lay the door on top of the crate. The Ovation\nDoor stows out of the way, eliminating the need for additional space required\nfor a swing-out, hinged door. To close, lift the door and lower into place while\nreleasing the Safety Catch until the door reaches a closed position. The\nchannel-track door frame adds significant strength and security to the crate,\nand the low threshold of the door allows your pet to enter the crate\ncomfortably. With its fold &amp; carry configuration, Ovation sets up and folds down\nin seconds without the need for tools. Ovation includes a composite plastic pan\nfor easy cleanup in the event of an accident, plastic carrying handles to move\nthe folded crate from one location to another comfortably, surface protective\nrubber feet, and most importantly, a free divider panel for use while your puppy\ngrows into his adult-size home.\n<p><b>Features: <\/b>Up &amp; Away Door Conveniently Slides &amp; Stows Overhead.\nEasy-Glide Channel Track Door System Adds Strength.\nEasily Sets Up &amp; Folds Down in Seconds.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n<b>Color:<\/b> Blacks<br><b>Material:<\/b> Metal, Plastic<br><b>Frame Material:<\/b> Metal\n<br><b>Carrier Size:<\/b> 48 in<br><b>Pet Size:<\/b>\n91-130 lbs<br><b>Dimensions:<\/b>\n49.75 in L x 30.25 in W x 32.25 in H<br>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n"

We selected this particular timber as our signature wood because of its high durability and tight grain, which takes beautifully to a wide range of finishes. The wood also has the ability to minimize shrinkage, cracks and warps, making it the perfect candidate for the production of high-quality pet products.<p>\nRubberwood is best known for the production of latex, which is used worldwide for rubber-based products. So while other trees are cut down for the sole purpose of producing certain products, rubberwood is used only after it completes its latex-producing cycle and dies, which generally lasts 26-30 years.

Receiver unit may be placed on table tops, by doors, beds, couches, trash cans or anywhere that is \"off limits\" to pets. The lightweight electronic pet collar sends an ultrasonic signal that triggers a loud sonic blast at the receiver unit to make your pet scat! Dogs and cats are easily trained to stay away. This ultrasonic system is superior to cheaper infrared devices because it allows people to come and go without triggering the alarm. The sonic alarm is triggered only by your pet's individual electronic transmitting collar. Range is fully adjustable from 1 foot up to 35 feet. System includes one receiver module and one pet collar transmitter. Transmitter comes with lithium battery. Standard 9 Volt battery required for receiver (not included).

The Small Animal Heated Pad Cover is an excellent way to add comfort to the Small Animal Heated Pad. The soft weave allows the warmth to radiate through to the animal. Only 25 watts is all that's needed to keep the indoor or outdoor pet warm and comfy even in the coldest of climates. The 9\" X 12\" size is perfect for Rabbits, Guinea Pigs or Ferrets and is ideal for the rehabilitation of wildlife. The internal thermostat is preset to be the perfect temperature. We've cleverly rounded all the edges to take away a chewing surface and even capped the cord entrance and the first 18\" of the power cord with steel. Holes in the 4 corners of the pad are the perfect anchor points to keep the pad in place. Screws can be used to anchor the pad on wood surfaces or wired in place for wire floored cages. The Small Animal Heated Pad is the perfect warm spot for any small animal.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Features:<\/strong> Soft weave allows warmth to radiate, Made of Faux Lambskin, <br>\n<strong>Includes:<\/strong> 1 Heat Pad Cover (<em>heating pad sold separately<\/em>)\n<strong><br>\nColor:<\/strong> Gray<br>\n<strong>Environment:<\/strong> Indoor &amp; Outdoor<br>\n<strong>Dimensions:<\/strong> 12\"L x 9\"W x .25\"H<br>\n<strong>Pet Size:<\/strong> Small<br>\n<strong>Compatible With:<\/strong> Small Animal Heated Pad (<em>sold separately<\/em>) <br>\n<strong>Exterior Material:<\/strong> Faux Lambskin<br>\n<strong>Cleaning Instructions:<\/strong> Cover is machine washable.\n<\/div>\n"
