The difference in models is for the animal's stride length (larger ramps for dogs with longer strides), or the application (any size animal needs the larger ramp when the application is on a dock, bulkhead, or boat because of the varied distance to the water.<\/p>\n<p>The Skamper Ramp is blow-molded for strength and is best suited for frequent use and any size (even large) pet. It snaps together (no nuts, bolts or flexible wing strips), and is the best solution for vinyl-lined pools. It is made of a 100% recyclable blow-molded plastic that is UV- and chemical-resistant. It is safe even for all vinyl-lined, permanent pools and comes with all assembly and installation parts. Deck and assembly hardware included, except for deck screw and masonry anchor.

They not only protect them against drowning, but also allow\nthem to safely get out of a pool, back on a dock or aboard most boats on their\nown. This simple white, hi-tech plastic ramp attaches to the deck of the pool,\nwalled pond, or even most docks and some boats. Because all living beings see\nwhite, animals can see it\u0097day or night\u0097and they \"skamper\" out of the water on\nthe ramp by themselves! This gives Pet Parents and animal lovers alike\nunprecedented peace of mind in terms of water safety.<\/p>\n<p>Skamper-Ramp comes in two sizes, both capable of holding 200 lbs of animal:\nregular, for smaller, short-stride animals frequent and\/or emergency use, and\nthe Super Skamper-Ramp, for larger pets with longer stride length and\/or for any\nsize pet if used with a dock or boat. The difference in models is for the\nanimal's stride length (larger ramps for dogs with longer strides), or the\napplication (any size animal needs the larger ramp when the application is on a\ndock, bulkhead, or boat because of the varied distance to the water.<\/p>\n<p>The Skamper Ramp is blow-molded for strength and is best suited for frequent\nuse and any size (even large) pet. It snaps together (no nuts, bolts or flexible\nwing strips), and is the best solution for vinyl-lined pools. It is made of a\n100% recyclable blow-molded plastic that is UV- and chemical-resistant. It is\nsafe even for all vinyl-lined, permanent pools and comes with all assembly and\ninstallation parts. Deck and assembly hardware included, except for deck screw\nand masonry anchor. If you don't wish to screw an anchor into your deck, you can\nuse existing anchors, railings, or other tie-down points.<\/p>\n<p><b>Additional Information at a Glance:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides animals with a way out of their water entrapment on their own<\/li>\n<li>Made of strong, lightweight, blowmolded polyethylene that is chemical &amp;\nUV-resistant<\/li>\n<li>Easy to snap-together assembly<\/li>\n<li>Super Skamper-Ramp is required for dock or boat use, regardless of the\nwild animal or pet's size<\/li>\n<li>1-year warranty against product manufacturer defect<\/li>\n<li>Safe for vinyl lined pools<\/li>\n<li>100% recyclable<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n"
