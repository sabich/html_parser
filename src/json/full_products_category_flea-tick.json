Sensitivities may occur using any pesticide product for pets. If signs of sensitivity occur, bathe your pet with mild soap and rinse with large amounts of water. If signs continue, consult a veterinarian immediately.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>How to Use: <\/b><br>\nWet the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat for 2-3 minutes with warm water. Apply shampoo on head and ears and lather. Then repeat procedure with neck, chest, and middle and hindquarters, finishing legs last and paying special attention to the footpads (between the toes) and underbody areas. Wash the head and ear areas carefully, making sure to keep the shampoo out of the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. NOTE: A drop of glycerin in each eye before bathing may prevent or reduce irritation if the shampoo gets in the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. Pay special attention to the base of the tail, as it is a place frequented by fleas. Fully lather animal and let lather remain on animal for 5 minutes before rinsing thoroughly with water. NOTE: This fi nal step is an important part of grooming procedure. For small dogs less than 15 pounds, wrapping the animal in a towel for several minutes to absorb moisture is advised. This also will allow dying fleas and ticks to crawl off animal into the towel before drying animal with a towel or blow dryer. Flea and tick control on the animal is only part of the solution to the problem. The inside of the house and the outdoor area used by the animal must also be treated for complete control.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Hazards to Humans and Domestic Animals: <\/b><br>\nCauses substantial but temporary eye injury.

TO KILL FLEAS AND TICKS: Hold the container upright.\nSpray at a distance of 8 to 12 inches. Spray over entire haircoat making\nsure the coat is thoroughly wetted to the skin. As you spray, fluff the hair\nso the spray will penetrate to the skin. Make sure spray wets ticks\nthoroughly. Spray against the lay of the hair, roughing the hair on long-haired\ndogs or cats.

Advantage\u00ae Treatment Spray for Dogs contains a combination of ingredients that stops the flea life cycle and kills other listed insects.

The third active ingredient enhances the killing activity of Pyrethrins. The combination of ingredients in Advantage\u00ae Treatment Spray for Dogs kills adult fleas, and hatching fleas and flea eggs for 100 days before they grow up to bite. Nylar\u00ae continues to kill hatching fleas and flea eggs for 100 days by preventing their development into the adult biting stage. Advantage\u00ae Treatment Spray for Dogs can also be used to kill fleas hidden in carpets, rugs, draperies, upholstery, pet bedding, floor cracks, and cabinets. Occasionally adult fleas may be present intreated areas when reintroduced from infested animals. As part of a complete flea control program, treat pets and indoor areas where animals frequent using EPA registered outdoor spray and flea and tick spray.

If you do see an adverse reaction, wash your cat with a shampoo or dishwashing liquid that contains detergents, as this is the most effective way to remove the oils causing the reaction.

Hold the animal for a few seconds to allow the liquid to absorb. <br>4. Work any excess oil into hair before allowing your pet near furniture.

Do not allow children to apply product. Use on dogs ONLY. Do not use on cats, rabbits, or other animals. Do not apply more than once per month.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>FREQUENCY OF APPLICATION<\/b><br>\nCERTIFECT\u00c2\u00ae detaches ticks when applied to a dog with a pre-existing infestation. Do not apply more than once a month.<\/p>\n<p>\nResearch demonstrates that CERTIFECT\u00c2\u00ae kills adult fleas (Ctenocephalides felis and Ct. canis), flea eggs, and flea larvae for up to three months. CERTIFECT\u00c2\u00ae also prevents development of all flea stages for up to three months. Although CERTIFECT\u00c2\u00ae can control fleas for up to three months, if there is a high risk of reinfestation or if the pet has fleas which may cause flea allergy dermatitis, a once monthly application may be needed.<\/p>\n<p>\nCAUTION: Harmful if swallowed. Causes moderate eye irritation. Avoid contact with eyes or clothing. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum, using tobacco, or using the toilet. Prolonged or frequently repeated skin contact may cause allergic reactions in some individuals.<\/p>\n<p>\nDo not contact the treated area until completely dry. Individual sensitivities, while rare, may occur after using any pesticide product. SIDE EFFECTS: temporary lethargy and pruritis (itching) may occur with the use of this product. If signs persist, or become more severe within a few days of application, consult a veterinarian immediately. DO NOT use on dogs that have been diagnosed with diabetes or heart problems. Consult a veterinarian before using on dogs that are medicated, debilitated, aged or obese. Certain medications can interact with pesticides. Amitraz is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI); therefore, people taking MAOI-containing medication must take particular care when handling this product.
