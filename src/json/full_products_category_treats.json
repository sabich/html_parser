In the mountains surrounding Mt. Everest at more than 15,000 feet, it is made using traditional methods with yak and\/or cow milk, and all natural products with no preservatives or binding agents. They're also gluten free! Depending on the size and eating habits of the dog, this can be a very long-lasting dog chew. Dogs must work the end of the treat for hours, softening it with their mouths before small parts of it can be slowly chewed off. When you give this treat to your dog, you know that you are providing them with high-quality eating entertainment. You can even microwave the end pieces on high power for 30 second to 2 minutes* to create a cheesy puffed treat! *Never leave your microwave unattended and be careful to not over puff cheese. ALWAYS allow cheese to cool for at least two minutes before giving to your dog.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Key Benefits: <\/b> <\/p>\n<li>All Natural chew<\/li>\n<li> Grain, Gluten, Lactose, and Soy Free<\/li>\n<li> Easily Digestible<\/li>\n<li> No preservatives or binding agents<\/li>\n<li> Healthy alternative to rawhide <br>\n<p><b>Item Number: <\/b> 5270817<br>\n<b>Brand: <\/b> Himalayan Pet Supply; Himalayan Dog Chew<br>\n<b>Food Type: <\/b> Chew<br>\n<b>Breed Size: <\/b> Medium; Large<br>\n<b>Life Stage: <\/b> Puppy, Adult, Senior, All Stages<br>\n<b>Nutritional Option: <\/b> Grain Free, Grain Free, No Wheat, No Soy, No Corn, High-Protein, Lactose Free<br>\n<b>Health Consideration:<\/b> General Health, Stress &amp; Anxiety Relief, Active<br>\n<b>Flavor:<\/b> Cheese<br>\n<b>Weight:<\/b> 10.5 oz (298 g)<br>\n<\/p>\n<p><b>NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION<\/b><br>\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Ingredients:<\/b><br> Cheese (pasteurized processed skimmed milk, salt, lime juice)\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Guaranteed Analysis:<\/b><br> Crude Protein Min 69.63%<br>Crude Fat Min 1.3%<br>Crude Fiber Max 0.6%<br>Moisture Max 13.44%<br>Ash Max 6.2%\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Caloric Content: <\/b> 3211 kcal\/kg, 319 kcal\/treat<br>\n<\/p>\n<p><b>FEEDING INSTRUCTIONS<\/b><\/p>\n<p> This is a complimentary treat for dogs 12 weeks old and older.
