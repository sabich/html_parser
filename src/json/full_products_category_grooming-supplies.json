This will cause the nail to extend slightly, making it easier for you to see the nail. Trim the nail at a 45-degree angle so that the newly cut nail is flush with the floor when you pet walks. There is a blood vessel, in each nail, called the quick. Do not cut the nail so short that you cut the quick. Always cut just the excess nail. The pinkish color of the quick is easy to see in pets with light-colored nails. However, it is almost impossible to see on dogs with dark nails. To avoid cutting the quick, locate it from the underside of each nail before you begin cutting. Cut each nail back just a little at a time until you get close, but not right up to the quick. If you do inadvertently cut the quick, apply pressure to stop bleeding. Use a nail file immediately after trimming your dog's nails to remove any rough edges.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n"

Causes moderate eye irritation. Avoid contact with eyes or clothing. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling. Keep out of reach of children. Do not contaminate feed or food.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Directions: <\/b><br>\nIt is a violation of Federal Law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.\nREAD ENTIRE LABEL BEFORE EACH USE. USE ONLY ON DOGS. Follow all precautions and directions. For use on Dogs over the age of 12 weeks for control of Fleas and Ticks. Do not repeat treatment for 7 days. Do not use on puppies under 12 weeks. Consult a veterinarian before using this product on debilitated, aged, pregnant, or nursing animals. Sensitivities may occur using any pesticide product for pets. If signs of sensitivity occur, bathe your pet with mild soap and rinse with large amounts of water. If signs continue, consult a veterinarian immediately.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>How to Use: <\/b><br>\nWet the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat for 2-3 minutes with warm water. Apply shampoo on head and ears and lather. Then repeat procedure with neck, chest, and middle and hindquarters, finishing legs last and paying special attention to the footpads (between the toes) and underbody areas. Wash the head and ear areas carefully, making sure to keep the shampoo out of the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. NOTE: A drop of glycerin in each eye before bathing may prevent or reduce irritation if the shampoo gets in the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. Pay special attention to the base of the tail, as it is a place frequented by fleas. Fully lather animal and let lather remain on animal for 5 minutes before rinsing thoroughly with water. NOTE: This fi nal step is an important part of grooming procedure. For small dogs less than 15 pounds, wrapping the animal in a towel for several minutes to absorb moisture is advised. This also will allow dying fleas and ticks to crawl off animal into the towel before drying animal with a towel or blow dryer. Flea and tick control on the animal is only part of the solution to the problem. The inside of the house and the outdoor area used by the animal must also be treated for complete control.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>Hazards to Humans and Domestic Animals: <\/b><br>\nCauses substantial but temporary eye injury. Causes skin irritation. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or clothing. Harmful if inhaled. Avoid breathing product vapor. If available, wear protective eyewear such as goggles or safety glasses. Wear gloves made out of any waterproof material. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum, using tobacco, or using the toilet. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse. Combustible. Do not use or store near heat or open flame.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>First Aid: <\/b><br>\nIF IN EYES: Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the fi rst 5 minutes, then continue rinsing eyes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>IF ON SKIN OR CLOTHING: Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.\n<\/p>\n<p>IF INHALED: Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance. Then give artificial respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for further treatment advice.
