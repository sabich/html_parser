This allows you to tailor your own custom training program for most any dog.\n<p><b>Corrections<\/b><br>When the collar detects a bark or howl it generates an annoying \"correction\" which always consists of an audible tone and, if enabled, a low current shock. The dog learns that the annoyance goes away when the barking or howling stops.<\/p>\n<p><b>Progressive Corrections<\/b><br>\nThe number and frequency of corrections progressively increases if the dog keeps barking or howling. The first correction is just a short tone to get the dogs attention, but following corrections add shock (if enabled) and multiple pulses if the dog continues to bark or howl.<\/p>\n<p><b>Automatic Correction Reduction<\/b><br>\nAs the dog's barking slows the processor automatically reduces the frequency and intensity of the corrections. When there is no barking\/howling for 30 seconds, the correction is reduced to its minimum.<\/p>\n<p><b>Panic Recovery Period<\/b><br>\nIf the dog happens to panic and bark or howl uncontrollably for more than 15 seconds, the processor disables all corrections for a 20 second recovery period to let the dog calm down.<\/p>\n<p><b>Bark vs. Noise<\/b><br>\nDetection of a bark is relatively reliable in the BT-3 due to the internal digital processing. However any very loud sound that has the same amplitude envelope and duration of a normal dog bark can be missinterpreted as a bark and generate an unnecessary correction. This is confusing to the dog. Therefore when you first start using a BT3 we recommend you avoid locations where there is a chance of loud sounds triggering the collar. This includes areas such as automotive repair shops, and construction zones.<\/p>\n<p><b>The No-Bark Reward<\/b><br>\nIf your dog has not barked in a long time, the first bark or loud noise will nottrigger a correction. This feature prevents generation of an unnecessary correction to a random event such as something falling and creating a loud noise. This feature is implemented in the Normal and Anti-Intruder modes, but not the Howl-Prevention mode.<\/p>\n<p><b>Continuous Status Indicators<\/b><br>\nDuring normal operation, the BATT and SHOCK lights will flash in synchronization with every tone and shock correction respectively. This may be used to visually observe the corrections if you cannot hear the tone.<\/p>\n<p>What You Achieve Is A Well-Behaved Dog That Only Barks When It's Supposed To!\nWhen used consistently, the Bark Terminator 3 quickly trains your dog to stop barking and be what he's supposed to be - a happy, well-trained companion.<\/p>\n<p>\nEffective on Dogs from 5lbs to 150lbs\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n"

Potty training bells should stay on the door at all times to be accessible whenever your dog needs to go out. <br>Step 2: Your dog needs to be taught to tap the bells with his paw, nose, or tail. To do that, familiarize your dog with the bells when it is time for him to go out to potty. Say \"Let's go potty, ring the bells\" while pointing to the potty training bells. <br>Step 3: Help him ring the bells, then praise him and allow him to go out. To encourage the desired behavior, be consistent and use the same phrase and actions with your dog every time he needs to go potty, prompting him to ring the bells. <br>Step 4: Eventually you dog will associate ringing the bells with being let out to do his business and will ring them on his own. Make sure you respond immediately to your dog ringing the Potty training bells to avoid accidents or unwanted behavior. Praise him every time. <\/p>\n<p>Note: This is a training device, not a toy!<\/p>\n<p><b>Personalize This Product<\/b><br>\nYou can personalize this product with one line of personalization and up to 7 characters including spaces.

This fashionable and functional product makes potty training your dog fun!<p><b>Directions:<\/b><br> Step 1: Hang or secure your Li'l Pals Potty Training Bell on the door your dog uses to go outside. Potty training bells should stay on the door at all times to be accessible whenever your dog needs to go out. <br>Step 2: Your dog needs to be taught to tap the bells with his paw, nose, or tail. To do that, familiarize your dog with the bells when it is time for him to go out to potty. Say \"Let's go potty, ring the bells\" while pointing to the potty training bells. <br>Step 3: Help him ring the bells, then praise him and allow him to go out. To encourage the desired behavior, be consistent and use the same phrase and actions with your dog every time he needs to go potty, prompting him to ring the bells. <br>Step 4: Eventually you dog will associate ringing the bells with being let out to do his business and will ring them on his own. Make sure you respond immediately to your dog ringing the Potty training bells to avoid accidents or unwanted behavior. Praise him every time. <\/p>\n<p>Note: This is a training device, not a toy!<\/p>\n<p><b>Personalize This Product<\/b><br>\nYou can personalize this product with one line of personalization and up to 7 characters including spaces.

It teaches your pets to avoid areas inside your home and outside in your yard. The waterproof and battery operated Mini Pet Barrier fits easily in small spaces. It will keep your pet off kitchen counters, away from the trash, and off your furniture. The Transmitter sends an elliptical radio signal. Your pet wears a Receiver Collar with Contact Points that touch his neck. When your pet enters the Barrier Area, he'll hear a series of beeps from the collar followed by a safe, progressive Static Correction. It is designed to startle. This method has been proven safe, and will not harm your pet. Your pet will quickly learn to avoid the Barriers you have set up. There are distinct settings for multiple pets. Easy set-up and training for dogs and cats weighing 5 pounds and up. An unlimited number of pets can be added to the system as long as they are wearing a PetSafe Pawz Away or YardMax Receiver Collar.\n<p><b>Features: <\/b>Creates avoidance areas up to 5 feet<br>\n<b>Includes: <\/b> <br>\n<\/p>\n<li>Barrier Transmitter (3 alkaline AAA batteries required, not included)\n<\/li>\n<li>Receiver Collar with (2) 3-volt lithium batteries\n<\/li>\n<li>Test Light Tool\n<\/li>\n<li>Cat collar strap<br>\n<\/li>\n<li> Operating and Training Guide<br>\n<b>Dimensions: <\/b> Receiver Collar 2.19\" L x 1.20\" W x 1.28\" H, .11 lbs., Barrier Transmitter: 2.99\" L x 2.99\" W x 1.01\" H, .18 lbs.<br>\n<b>Cleaning Instructions: <\/b> Nylon receiver collar strap may be washed.

For pets 6 months or older or once they can learn basic obedience commands like \"sit\" and \"stay\". A collar worn for too long or made too tight on the pet's neck may cause skin damage. Ranging from redness to pressure ulcers; this condition is commonly known as bed sores. Avoid leaving the collar on the pet for more than 12 hours per day.\n<\/li>\n<\/div>\n"

The system is designed to act as a deterrent, using Static Correction to condition pets to remain outside of the established barrier area. It is important that you reinforce training with your pet on a regular basis. Since the tolerance level to Static Correction varies from pet to pet, Radio Systems Corporation CANNOT guarantee that the system will in all cases keep a pet outside of the established barrier area. Not all pets can be trained to avoid entering the barrier area. Therefore, if you have reason to believe that your pet may harm himself or pose a danger to others if he is not kept from entering the barrier area, you should NOT rely solely upon this system to restrict your pet. Radio Systems Corporation shall NOT be liable for any personal injuries, property damage, injury to or death of your pet, economic loss or any consequential damages sustained as a result of any animal entering the barrier area.\n<p><b>Warning: <\/b><br> WARNING indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury.\n<\/p>\n<p><b>How the System Works: <\/b><br>\nThe PetSafe Pawz Away Mini Pet Barrier keeps your pet away from a certain room, away from trash, off of furniture, etc. Just place the Barrier Transmitter near the area your pet should avoid. The Mini Pet Barrier transmits an elliptical radio signal adjustable up to 5 feet. Your pet wears a Receiver Collar with Contact Points that touch his neck. When your pet enters the Barrier Area, he'll hear a series of audible tones from the Receiver Collar and he will feel a safe Progressive Static Correction, delivered through the Contact Points on his neck. The Progressive Static Correction will get his attention, but will not cause\nharm. The correction continues until your pet leaves the Barrier Area. The PetSafe Pawz Away Mini Pet Barrier has been proven safe, comfortable, and effective for pets at least 6 months old and 5 pounds or more.\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n"
